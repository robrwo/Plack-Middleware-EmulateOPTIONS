# NAME

Plack::Middleware::EmulateOPTIONS - handle OPTIONS requests as HEAD

# VERSION

version v0.4.1

# SYNOPSIS

```perl
use Plack::Builder;

builder {

  enable "EmulateOPTIONS",
    filter => sub {
        my $env = shift;
        return $env->{PATH_INFO} =~ m[^/static/];
      };

  ...

};
```

# DESCRIPTION

This middleware adds support for handling HTTP `OPTIONS` requests, by internally rewriting them as `HEAD` requests.

If the requests succeed, then it will add `Allow` headers using the ["callback"](#callback) method.

If the requests do not succeed, then the responses are passed unchanged.

You can add the ["filter"](#filter) attribute to determine whether it will proxy `HEAD` requests.

# ATTRIBUTES

## filter

This is an optional code reference for a function that takes the [PSGI](https://metacpan.org/pod/PSGI) environment and returns true or false as to
whether the request should be proxied.

For instance, if you have CORS handler for a specific path, you might return false for those requests. Alternatively,
you might use the ["callback"](#callback).

If you need a different value for the `Allow` headers, then you should handle the requests separately.

## callback

This is an optional code reference that modifies the response headers.

By default, it sets the `Allow` header to "GET, HEAD, OPTIONS".

If you override this, then you will need to manually set the header yourself, for example:

```perl
use Plack::Util;

enable "EmulateOPTIONS",
  callback => sub($res, $env) {

      my @allowed = qw( GET HEAD OPTIONS );
      if ( $env->{PATH_INFO} =~ m[^/api/] ) {
         push @allowed, qw( POST PUT DELETE );
      }

      Plack::Util::header_set( $res->[1], 'allow', join(", ", @allowed) );

    };
```

This was added in v0.2.0.

# SUPPORT FOR OLDER PERL VERSIONS

Since v0.4.0, the this module requires Perl v5.20 or later.

Future releases may only support Perl versions released in the last ten (10) years.
